I love Twitter, but for a few years now I've been thinking about purging my archive. Not that I think I'll be [James Gunn'd](https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/) or anything like that. I just like the idea that Twitter is ephemeral and should be treated as such. So I did it. I kept an archive for myself, but a decade of tweets have been wiped out--though parts of my archive will float around in Google's cache and the Internet Archive.

I'm also trying out [Mastodon](https://mastodon.xyz/@ianpaul) right now, and really enjoying it. There aren't a ton of people on it, but those who are there are active.
