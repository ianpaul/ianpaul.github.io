I am a freelance writer based in Israel. I regularly contribute to PCWorld as an anti-virus and VPN critic, deal hunter, and whatever else catches my interest. Prior to my role as a freelance critic and feature contributor, I spent nearly a decade covering the latest technology news for PCWorld.

My work has appeared online at ABC News, Greenbot, [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/ian-paul), [Lifewire.com](https://www.lifewire.com/ian-paul-3571845), Macworld, MSNBC, Reuters, TechHive, [Yahoo Tech](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-21st-century-is-coming-to-1318404005756982.html), and The Washington Post.

Prior to my career as a freelance writer, I worked as a press representative for Kirshbaum, Demler & Associates--now [Kirshbaum Associates Inc](http://www.kirshbaumassociates.com/). During my time there I helped represent some of the biggest names in classical music including the Emerson String Quartet, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Sir András Schiff, Robert Spano, and Pinchas Zukerman.
